# Smaller-Projects (Upload clean notebooks is Work In Progress)

1. Supervised ML algorithms for Churn Prediction.
2. Database Management:
Creation of a Database with simulated data and querying it using MySQL
3. Hierarchical Clustering:
Experimented several clustering techniques on international banks. In particular, it has been focused on agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms. The project has been performed entirely using R language, which provided several good statistics as stopping criteria to find the best number of clusters.
4. Time Series Analysis
Multivariate Time Series Prediction of Italian GDP from 1970 to 2016.
Data taken from OECD. Models experimented: AR, MA, ARIMA, ARCH, GARCH.
5. Custom Target Encoding Class
Developing a custom Python Class to transform a categorical variable to a continuous, with several specific criteria to avoid overfitting.
